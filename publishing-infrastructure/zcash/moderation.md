# Moderation Policy (Public) — v0.1

## Purpose

This PeerTube instance exists to publish and steward Zcash ecosystem video in a way that supports long-term community access and responsible operations.

* How we publish: [https://zkav.club/publishing-infrastructure/zcash/publishing](https://zkav.club/publishing-infrastructure/zcash/publishing)
* Monthly reports: [https://zkav.club/publishing-infrastructure/zcash/reports](https://zkav.club/publishing-infrastructure/zcash/reports)
* Project hub: [https://zkav.club/publishing-infrastructure/zcash/](https://zkav.club/publishing-infrastructure/zcash/)

## Who this policy applies to

* Anyone viewing content on the instance
* Anyone with an account on the instance
* Any channel owner, uploader, moderator, or administrator

## Roles

* **Administrators:** instance configuration, security, federation policy, account creation controls, backups/updates, and final escalation authority.
* **Moderators:** handle reports, enforce this policy, and maintain federation decisions log.
* **Channel owners:** responsible for content and metadata quality within their channels; coordinate uploads with trusted uploaders.
* **Trusted uploaders:** may upload to specific channels as authorized; uploads are unlisted until approved.

## Account access (MVP)

* Registration is **invite-only**.
* Uploading is limited to a **trusted uploader list**.

## Publishing workflow and visibility (MVP)

* New uploads are **unlisted until approved**.
* A video is “published” when it is **public** and meets the metadata minimums.

## What is allowed

We aim to host content that is relevant to the Zcash ecosystem, including (non-exhaustive):

* Conference/event recordings
* Tutorials and technical talks
* Interviews and community updates
* Educational content that supports Zcash adoption and understanding

## What is not allowed

The instance will not host content that includes:

* Illegal content or instructions facilitating illegal activity
* Harassment, hate, or targeted abuse
* Non-consensual intimate imagery
* Doxxing or sharing private personal information
* Malware, phishing, or scams
* Spam or misleading impersonation

Definitions (MVP):

* Spam: bulk, repetitive, or deceptive content intended to manipulate discovery, distribute scams, or disrupt normal use.
* Misleading impersonation: presenting yourself as another person or organization (or as an official representative) in a way that is likely to confuse viewers.

## Reporting

* Viewers can report videos/accounts via PeerTube’s reporting tools.
* Include as much detail as possible (timestamps, description of issue).
* Privacy note: reports may include sensitive information. Access is limited to moderators/admins, and we avoid publishing personally identifying details when documenting outcomes.
* We do not publish moderator notes or report details publicly, except in aggregate.

## Response targets (MVP)

* **Illegal/urgent:** same day
* **Other reports:** within 72 hours

## Enforcement actions

Depending on severity and context, actions may include:

* Requesting edits/clarifications from the uploader/channel owner
* Unlisting or removing a video
* Suspending or removing uploader access
* Suspending an account
* Instance-level federation actions (block/unfollow)

## Appeals

* Users may appeal moderation decisions via the instance contact method once the instance is live (we will link it here when available).
* Appeals should include the link, a description, and the requested remedy.

## Special cases

The following categories may be handled with faster or more restrictive actions while a review is completed:

* Doxxing / personal data: may be unlisted immediately while reviewing.
* Credible safety threats: may be unlisted immediately and escalated to admins.
* Impersonation: may require verification or removal of misleading identifiers.
* Copyright or rights disputes: content may be unlisted while we assess the request and available evidence.
* Disputes with channel owners: moderators handle routine cases. If a channel owner wants content public but moderators flag it, the video remains unlisted until resolved; admins are the final escalation authority.

## Federation policy (MVP)

* Federation is **curated**.
* We may block or unfollow instances that routinely distribute spam, harassment/hate, or other policy-violating content.
* We maintain a simple federation log (date + action + reason). For operational tracking, see the federation log stub on the hub page: [https://zkav.club/publishing-infrastructure/zcash/](https://zkav.club/publishing-infrastructure/zcash/)

What “curated” means (MVP):

* We do not aim to federate with everything by default.
* We may proactively block/unfollow instances that create repeated moderation overhead or distribute policy-violating content.
* Federation decisions are documented in the log.

## Transparency

We will publish:

* This moderation policy
* A high-level description of our federation posture
* Sustainability notes (cost drivers and how operations are supported)

## Policy changes

This policy may evolve as the instance grows. Material changes should be reflected in the hub page change log: [https://zkav.club/publishing-infrastructure/zcash/](https://zkav.club/infrastructure/zcash/)
