# Lead Your Own Zk Av Club Workshop

In 2026 we’re evolving Zk Av Club Workshops into a simple format: conversational sessions where people learn by doing.

Foundry isn’t continuing as a program, but last year’s sessions are still great examples of the culture—practical, friendly, experimental.

If you want to teach something, test an idea in public, or learn together with your community, you’re in the right place.

## What are Zk Av Club Workshops?

Zk Av Club Workshops are conversational learning sessions where people learn by doing. They can be technical or non-technical, beginner-friendly or advanced, and held in any language.

What we want:

* **Real back-and-forth** (not just lectures) 

* **Shared exploration** (we build understanding together) 

* **Useful outcomes** (skills, artifacts, or clear next steps)

## Why facilitate?

* **Community impact:** Share practical knowledge, unblock others, and help communities build real capability. 

* **Personal growth:** Improve teaching, communication, and facilitation. 

* **Visibility + connection:** Meet aligned collaborators and join an open learning network. 

* **Support + reward:** We help you produce + promote—and facilitators are **paid in Zcash**.

## What kinds of workshops fit?

We’re intentionally broad. Bring your craft.

* **Technical:** tooling, privacy workflows, node ops, dev onboarding, infrastructure, security basics 

* **Media + production:** recording, editing, livestreaming, captions, archiving, documentation workflows 

* **Community skills:** facilitation, governance patterns, communication, onboarding, storytelling 

* **Creative + experimental:** demos, “build with me,” teardown sessions, clinic-style troubleshooting

If it helps a community do something real, it probably fits.

* **Accessibility:** live translation, real-time transcription, speech-to-text 

* **Community broadcasting:** amplifying events without centralizing control 

* **Recording Station practice:** field workflow, recaps, lessons learned 

* **Research + archiving:** “hacker-librarian” methods and durable publishing

## How it works in 2026

1. **You propose an idea** — what you’ll teach/explore and what attendees will walk away with.

   * Proposal form → [https://tally.so/r/A7B0MD](https://tally.so/r/A7B0MD)

2. **We shape it together** — tighten scope, clarify outcomes, design for participation.

3. **We schedule + promote** — with enough runway to recruit participants.

4. **We run a test session** — quick tech check for audio/video/screen share.

5. **Host it live** — where your people already are. Participation matters: Q&A, exercises, discussion.

6. **Livestream or record + publish** — so the knowledge keeps working after the live moment.

**Recording is required for facilitator payment. If a session can’t be recorded, it doesn’t run as a Zk Av Club Workshop.**

When capacity allows, we can also support restreaming and/or simultaneous translation.

## What your proposal should include

* **Topic + learning outcomes** 

* **Format** (single or series; demo / guided exercise / teardown / clinic / discussion) 

* **Date window + duration** 

* **Language** 

* **Materials/links** (repo/docs/slides/examples) 

* **Promotion (lightweight):** commit to sharing once with your network

## Our collaboration principle

Zk Av Club is not here to extract value from contributors. We’re here to support people who do real work.

* We collaborate openly and give clear credit. 

* We aim for durable public knowledge (recordings + documentation). 

* We treat workshops as community infrastructure, not content farming.
