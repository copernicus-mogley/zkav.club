# Lead Your Own Zk Av Club Foundry Workshop!

In 2026 we’re entering a new phase of Zk Av Club Workshops — built around what makes the club work: community conversation and hands-on collaboration.

Last year we ran the Zk Av Club Foundry series (including Salons and Workshops). Foundry isn’t continuing as a program, but those sessions are still solid examples of the learning culture we’re growing: practical, friendly, experimental, and shaped by the people who show up.

If you want to teach something, test an idea in public, or learn together with your community, you’re in the right place.

## Examples from past workshops

Want to get a feel for the vibe and range of topics? We keep an archive of past sessions:

* Previous workshops: [https://www.zkav.club/workshops/past/](https://www.zkav.club/workshops/past/)

The list is intentionally mixed: classic skill-shares (editing, transcription, translation) and “program experiments” from Zk Av Club Foundry (recaps, how-we-do-this sessions, and community ops).

Common themes across the full list:

* Editing clinics: open-source editing tools, clip-contest workflows 

* Remote production: livestreaming/restreaming, privacy-first calls, broadcast setups 

* Accessibility: live translation, real-time transcription, speech-to-text
 
* Community broadcasting: how to amplify events without centralizing control 

* Recording Station practice: field workflow, recaps, lessons learned 

* Research + archiving: “Hacker‑Librarian” methods and durable publishing

## What are Zk Av Club Workshops?

Zk Av Club Workshops are conversational learning sessions where people learn by doing. They can be technical or non-technical, beginner-friendly or advanced, and held in any language.

What we want:

* Real back-and-forth (not just lectures) 

* Shared exploration (we build understanding together) 

* Useful outcomes (skills, artifacts, or clear next steps)

Workshops can be standalone sessions or a series, and can happen wherever your community already meets.

## Why facilitate a workshop?

### Community impact

Share practical knowledge, unblock others, and help communities build real capability.

### Personal growth

Improve your teaching, communication, and facilitation skills.

### Visibility + connection

You meet aligned collaborators and become part of a global network committed to open learning and purposeful tech.

### Support + reward

We help you produce and promote the session — and workshops are monetized, with compensation for your time and experience, paid in Zcash.

## What kinds of workshops fit?

We’re intentionally broad. Bring your craft.

* Technical: tooling, privacy workflows, node ops, dev onboarding, infrastructure, security basics 

* Media + production: recording, editing, livestreaming, captions, archiving, documentation workflows 

* Community skills: facilitation, governance patterns, communication, onboarding, storytelling 

* Creative + experimental: demos, “build with me” sessions, teardown sessions, clinic-style troubleshooting

If it helps a community do something real, it probably fits.

## How it works in 2026

### 1) You propose an idea

Share what you want to explore/teach and what attendees will walk away with.

### 2) We shape it together

We’ll tighten the scope, clarify learning outcomes, and design the session for participation.

### 3) We schedule + promote

We plan ahead so promotion and participant recruitment actually work.

### 4) We run a test session

A quick tech check for audio/video/screen share to reduce day-of stress.

### 5) Host it live — where your people already are

Discord, Telegram, community calls, etc. Live participation matters: Q&A, exercises, discussion, feedback loops.

### 6) We record it and publish it

Workshops are recorded and published so the knowledge keeps working after the live moment. This is also how we keep the program accountable and durable.

Recording is required for facilitator payment. If a session can’t be recorded, it doesn’t run as a Zk Av Club Workshop.

When capacity allows, we can also support restreaming and/or simultaneous translation.

## What your proposal should include

### Topic + learning outcomes

What’s the session about, and what will people be able to do afterward?

### Format + structure

Single workshop or series? What’s the shape: demo, guided exercise, teardown, clinic, discussion, Q&A, group build?

### Date + duration

Plan in advance so we can promote properly.

### Language

Any language is welcome.

### Materials + links

Anything participants should prepare? Repo/docs/slides/example files?

### Promotion (lightweight)

We’ll promote too, but your voice matters. A simple commitment to share it with your network goes a long way.

## Our collaboration principle

Zk Av Club is not here to extract value from contributors. We’re here to support people who do real work.

* We collaborate openly and give clear credit. 

* We aim for durable public knowledge (recordings + documentation). 

* We treat workshops as community infrastructure — not content farming.
