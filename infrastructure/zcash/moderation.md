# Moderation Policy (Public) — v0.1

This PeerTube instance exists to publish and steward Zcash ecosystem video in a way that supports long-term community access and responsible operations.

## Who this policy applies to

* Anyone viewing content on the instance

* Anyone with an account on the instance

* Any channel owner, uploader, moderator, or administrator

## Roles

* **Administrators:** instance configuration, security, federation policy, account creation controls, backups/updates, and final escalation authority.

* **Moderators:** handle reports, enforce this policy, and maintain federation decisions log.

* **Channel owners:** responsible for content and metadata quality within their channels; coordinate uploads with trusted uploaders.

* **Trusted uploaders:** may upload to specific channels as authorized; uploads are unlisted until approved.

## Account access (MVP)

* Registration is **invite-only**.

* Uploading is limited to a **trusted uploader list**.

## Publishing workflow and visibility (MVP)

* New uploads are **unlisted until approved**.

* A video is “published” when it is **public** and meets the metadata minimums.

## What is allowed

We aim to host content that is relevant to the Zcash ecosystem, including (non-exhaustive):

* Conference/event recordings

* Tutorials and technical talks

* Interviews and community updates

* Educational content that supports Zcash adoption and understanding

The instance will not host content that includes:

* Non-consensual intimate imagery

* Doxxing or sharing private personal information

* Malware, phishing, or scams

* Spam or misleading impersonation

## Reporting

* Viewers can report videos/accounts via PeerTube’s reporting tools.

* Include as much detail as possible (timestamps, description of issue).

## Response targets (MVP)

* **Illegal/urgent:** same day 

* **Other reports:** within 72 hours

## Enforcement actions

Depending on severity and context, actions may include:

* Requesting edits/clarifications from the uploader/channel owner

* Unlisting or removing a video

* Suspending or removing uploader access

* Suspending an account

* Instance-level federation actions (block/unfollow)

## Appeals

* Users may appeal moderation decisions by contacting the admins via the instance contact email.

* Appeals should include the link, a description, and the requested remedy.

## Federation policy (MVP)

* Federation is **curated**.

* We may block or unfollow instances that routinely distribute spam, harassment/hate, or other policy-violating content.

* We maintain a simple federation log (date + action + reason).

## Transparency

We will publish:

* This moderation policy

* A high-level description of our federation posture

* Sustainability notes (cost drivers and how operations are supported)
