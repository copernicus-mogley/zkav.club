# Monthly Reports and Sustainability Notes (rolling page) — v0.2

## Purpose

This page is the rolling monthly record for operating the Zcash PeerTube instance: what we shipped, what broke (if anything), what it cost, what took time, and what we’re doing next.

Project hub (plan + tracker): [https://www.zkav.club/infrastructure/zcash/](https://www.zkav.club/infrastructure/zcash/)

How we publish: [https://www.zkav.club/infrastructure/zcash/publishing](https://www.zkav.club/infrastructure/zcash/publishing)

Moderation policy: [https://www.zkav.club/infrastructure/zcash/moderation](https://www.zkav.club/infrastructure/zcash/moderation)

## How this page works

* This is **one rolling page** (not one page per month).
* Each month has its own section (e.g., `## 2026-02`).
* Update the current month as work happens. At month end, add a short summary and start the next month.

## Table of contents

* [2026-02](#2026-02)
* [2026-03](#2026-03)
* [2026-04](#2026-04)

## Cost drivers

* Storage growth
* Outbound bandwidth spikes
* Transcoding compute

## Scale triggers (MVP starting thresholds)

We revisit these after 30–60 days of real usage:

* Disk usage > 70% (sustained for 7 days)
* Bandwidth costs > $200/month (for 2 consecutive months)
* Moderation queue > 10 reports/week (for 2 consecutive weeks)
* Admin time > 10 hours/week (sustained for 4 weeks)

## What we report monthly (grant-aligned)

* Upload count + links
* Hosting/bandwidth costs
* Admin hours
* Storage growth (GB/month)
* Moderation load (reports/week)
