# Monthly Reports and Sustainability Notes (v1 template) — v0.1

## Purpose

This section documents the operational reality of running the instance: what costs money, what takes time, what changed this month, and what we’re doing about it.

## Cost drivers

* Storage growth 

* Outbound bandwidth spikes 

* Transcoding compute

## Scale triggers (MVP starting thresholds)

We revisit these after 30–60 days of real usage:

* Disk usage > 70% (sustained for 7 days) 

* Bandwidth costs > $200/month (for 2 consecutive months) 

* Moderation queue > 10 reports/week (for 2 consecutive weeks) 

* Admin time > 10 hours/week (sustained for 4 weeks)

## What we report monthly (grant-aligned)

* Upload count + links 

* Hosting/bandwidth costs 

* Admin hours 

* Storage growth (GB/month) 

* Moderation load (reports/week)
