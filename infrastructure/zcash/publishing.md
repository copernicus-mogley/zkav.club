# How We Publish (Public) — v0.1

## What this is

This page explains how videos are prepared, uploaded, reviewed, and published on the Zcash PeerTube instance.

## Who publishes here (MVP)

* Accounts are invite-only. 

* Uploads are limited to a trusted uploader list. 

* Channel owners coordinate what gets published in their channels.

## Channels and ownership (MVP)

* **Zcash Foundation — Zcon (historic + new):** channel owner is Zcash Foundation.

  * During MVP, Zk Av Club admins upload and manage metadata for historic Zcon videos in coordination with Zcash Foundation. 
  
* **ZecHub:** channel owner is ZecHub.

  * During MVP, this channel holds ZecHub programming (and other approved ecosystem content unless/until additional channels are created late MVP).

## Intake

A video enters the pipeline via one of:

* A channel owner request (planned batch, event drop, etc.) 

* An uploader request (if they are on the trusted uploader list)

Intake requests should specify:

* Which channel 

* Title + date/event 

* Any known rights/consent constraints (if applicable)

## Upload

The uploader:

* Uploads to the correct channel 

* Sets visibility to **unlisted** 

* Triggers transcoding (default settings) 

* Adds required metadata (see below)

## Metadata minimums (required)

* Title 

* Date/event 

* Speaker/participants (if applicable) 

* Description (what it is, context, links) 

* Tags 

* Language 

* License 

* Captions/subtitles (if available; otherwise mark as “not available yet”)

## Review (MVP)

A moderator/admin checks:

* Policy compliance 

* Correct channel placement 

* Basic quality (audio intelligibility; obvious technical issues) 

* Metadata minimums

## Publish

After approval:

* Set visibility to **public** 

* Add to any relevant playlists/collections 

* Confirm playback on web + mobile

## Post-publish

* Log link in monthly reporting 

* Note follow-ups (captions, edits, corrections, takedown requests)

## Changes and corrections

If a published video needs updates:

* Minor metadata fixes may be applied immediately 

* Substantive edits (content removals, sensitive material) should be coordinated with the channel owner and admins
