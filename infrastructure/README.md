# Community Media Infrastructure + Support

## Long-term publishing for decentralized communities

Zk Av Club runs community media infrastructure and provides support services that help decentralized technology communities publish recordings in a way that aligns with their needs and values.


## What we provide

### 1) Publishing systems

We help communities stand up and operate publishing destinations that people can actually depend on:

* Instance/channel setup and administration
* Repeatable publishing workflows
* Content organization for discovery

### 2) Content stewardship

Publishing is the start. We also support the ongoing work that keeps media usable:

* Indexing and metadata
* Rights + consent hygiene
* Versioning + updates


## Why decentralized media?

Community media is easiest to lose when it depends on a single platform’s incentives.

We focus on approaches that support:

* Community control
* Resilient distribution
* Long-term stewardship

PeerTube is a strong fit for many communities, but not the only one. Our job is to help each community choose a path that matches their values and constraints — and then make it work.

## Current implementation

### Decentralized media for Zcash

PeerTube for Zcash is our first public implementation under this umbrella, but it’s only one example. We expect to test, iterate, and support additional decentralized media options as we work with more communities.

If you’re looking for the Zcash PeerTube decision, rollout plan, and how publishing will work, start here:

[Zcash PeerTube](/infrastructure/zcash)

## What you can expect from Zk Av Club

We strive for:

* Clear standards for labeling, organization, and documentation
* Reliable upload + handoff workflows
* A steady path toward better accessibility
* Transparent scope: what we do, what we don’t, and how requests get handled

---

## Roadmap

Zcash is the starting point. Over time, this project will expand to include:

* Additional community media implementations (beyond PeerTube)
* Publishing playbooks and templates
* Indexing + metadata guidelines
* Support offerings for event recording pipelines

**Community media needs infrastructure.** We’re here to help build it.
