Hello, World! 

Welcome to our [Zk Av Club Recording Station](https://zkav.club/recording-station). By stepping up to the mic and cameras, you’re giving consent to be recorded and to the simple terms below. No signatures, no forms—just vibes and clarity.


## What you’re doing

After your edited piece goes out (on Zk Av Club and/or your channels), the original source files go to Internet Archive under [Creative Commons BY‑SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) so the community can learn from and remix. 


## Your comforts & choices

* **Review option:** If you want to check your recording before it goes out, just tell the crew—totally fine. 

* **Credit:** We’ll credit your name or pseudonym—your call. 

* **Sensitive topics?** Say so any time. We can edit before archiving, limit distribution, or keep it private.
