# Zk Av Club Recording Station Volunteer Kit

**Owner:** Zk Av Club (Lead Organizer)

**Status:** Published

**Last updated:** 2026-02-03

## 1) So you want to be a volunteer?

Here's everything you need to know!

**What we do:** we run a lightweight, human-friendly recording setup at events to produce recordings that can be published and archived for the long term.

**What success looks like:** guests feel respected and safe, recordings are clean and well-documented, and files move reliably from event → public archive.

## 2) Quick start

If you read nothing else, read this.

### Your three priorities

1. **People first:** guest comfort + consent always wins.
2. **Reliable signal:** stable audio is more important than perfect video.
3. **Clean handoff:** every file must be labeled and logged.

### Day-of checklist (ultra-short)

* Arrive early, find the station, sync with the team.
* Verify: microphones, levels, power, storage, camera angles, and crowd flow.
* Before each recording: confirm **Owner** (public profile as contact) + **Guests**’ names/pseudonyms + consent.
* During: monitor audio, tend to cameras, note issues, keep the vibe fun and chill.
* After: stop recording → confirm the file saved → update logs.
* End of day: strike the station, files renamed → copied + verified, notes shared.

## 3) What is the Recording Station

A Recording Station is an on-site, volunteer-run media lab where event-goers can record conversations, workshops, or experiments — and help build a community-made archive.

It’s designed to flip the script on event coverage: instead of top-down narration, we help in-person attendees share their stories on their own terms.

**Typical outputs per recording**

* Source files (video and/or audio)
* Optional: still photo of Guest(s)
* Metadata: title, owner, guests, event name, date/time, tags, links

**How it works (high level)**

* Find us at an event (book a slot)
* Record with the crew (optional host/prompts if you want)
* Owner approves the recording (or requests restrictions)
* After Owner approves the recording, source masters may be archived (see licensing section)

**Formats to spark inspiration**

Podcast-style conversations • Short-form interviews • Panel recaps & event reactions • Personal video journals • Experimental/creative pieces

**Quick definitions**

* **Owner:** the single person responsible for the recording (our main public point of contact).
* **Guests:** anyone appearing in the recording (speakers, interviewees, co-hosts, etc.).
* **Team:** the volunteers operating the Recording Station for the activation.

## 4) Roles on-site (volunteer team)

We run cool and lean. People may wear multiple hats.

### A) Lead Organizer / Producer (volunteer on-site)

* Runs the schedule and people flow
* Handles consent and community coordination
* Resolves issues and makes final calls

### B) Technical Director (volunteer on-site)

* Responsible for the station’s signal flow and technical decisions (based on whatever volunteer-provided kit is being used for the activation)
* Helps volunteers learn the basics and, when appropriate, integrates volunteer-provided gear safely
* Troubleshoots failures quickly and calmly

### C) AV Operator / General Tech

* Starts/stops recordings, monitors audio, watches framing
* Tracks a simple log of takes and issues

### D) Guest Support / Runner

* Greets Guests, keeps timing, maintains a chill and inclusive vibe
* Helps with mic tips, test, and quick resets

### E) Data Steward (may be combined with another role)

* Renames files, checks storage, does verified copies
* Ensures files are renamed + logged before end-of-day copies/verification
* Maintains the file + metadata log for the activation

## 5) Expectations & culture

### What we expect from you

* Be available, communicate early if you can’t make it
* Ask questions when unsure (silence causes confusion)
* Respect boundaries: consent, privacy, and personal space
* Stay calm under pressure; we solve problems without blame

### Neutral media support policy (no shilling / no swag)

Recording Station is not a booth. We’re there as neutral media support and as part of the community.

* **No shilling:** don’t pitch products, services, tokens, or companies while volunteering.
* **No swag:** don’t hand out unapproved promotional items at/through the station.
* **Serve the whole event:** we’re available to all communities present (within the activation scope and schedule).
* **Follow the event’s code of conduct:** if there’s a conflict, the event’s rules win; escalate issues to the Lead Organizer.

### What you can expect from us

* Clear instructions and a point person for decisions
* Realistic scope: we prioritize quality over quantity
* Credit where appropriate, and public acknowledgment when possible

---

## 6) Consent, credits, and licensing

Consent is mandatory. If consent is unclear, we do not record.

No signatures, no forms — just clarity (and we log what was agreed).

### Minimum consent standard

Before recording, confirm:

* Which Guest is the Owner of the recording.
* All Guests understand they are being recorded.
* They know the intended distribution (long-term public archiving).
* They can ask for a pause/stop at any time.

### Practical consent script (30 seconds)

“Hi — we’re recording this session with Zk Av Club for the public archive (and possible publication). You can ask us to pause or stop at any time. Are you okay with being recorded and published?”

### Licensing & ownership (simple version)

* Owner keeps the copyright to the recorded material.
* Owner gives Zk Av Club a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license to edit, publish, share, and archive the recording (including short clips).

### Open by default

After recordings are approved by Owner, the source recordings may be published to Internet Archive under Creative Commons BY-SA (CC BY-SA) (unless other arrangements are agreed due to sensitivity/constraints).

### By participating, Guests agree that

* They have the right to share what they’re recording.
* All Guests consent to being recorded and published under the terms above (and the Owner can request restrictions).

### Your comforts & choices

* **Review option:** if a guest wants to review before anything goes out, that’s totally fine — note it and coordinate.
* **Credit choice:** name or pseudonym, guest’s call.
* **Sensitive topics:** we can agree on edits before archiving, limit distribution, or keep something private.
* **Change of mind later:** guests can reach out via the contact methods on zkav.club; we’ll do our best to accommodate reasonable requests.

### Privacy notes

* Do not record private conversations.
* Avoid filming audience faces when possible.
* If sensitive material comes up unexpectedly, flag it in the log.

### Event rules

Follow the event’s code of conduct and any media policy. If there’s a conflict, the event’s rules win — escalate to the Lead Organizer.

## 7) On-site workflow (standard operating flow)

### A) Pre-session (5–10 minutes)

* Confirm **Owner** (single individual with a public profile for contact)
* Confirm **Guests**’ names/pseudonyms (with links where desired), title/topic, pronouns (if offered)
* Confirm consent from all Guests
* Mic check: levels, placement (how to hold it)
* Room tone: record 30 seconds of clean audio before each session

### B) During session (5–30 minutes)

* Monitor audio continuously (headphones on)
* Watch for: cable bumps, battery warnings, low storage
* Write time-stamped notes for any issues (for post-production)

### C) Post-session (2–5 minutes)

* Stop recording cleanly (take a couple slow breaths before you hit that button)
* Confirm file exists and duration looks right
* Rename file(s) immediately (see naming standard)
* Update metadata log

---

## 8) File naming + metadata

Metadata is part of consent + credits. If it’s not labeled and logged, it’s not really "done".

### File naming standard (internal convention)

Use this format:

**YYYYMMDD_ID_EventShortName_OwnerPublic_Source_OriginalFilename**

* **Source** = identifier for the recording device (examples: iphone15, bm4k, handycam, zoomh6).
* **OwnerPublic** = the chosen owner’s public name/handle/pseudonym (never dox).
* Keep components short and filesystem-safe (avoid special characters).
* **OriginalFilename** remains to help track the file back to the source if necessary.

Examples:

* 20251004_10_DarkPrague_harryhalpin_handicam_C0014.MP4 
* 20251121_05_Devconnect_ProofOfVibes_rodecaster1_Recording90.wav

### Minimum metadata fields (station log)

* Date
* Event name
* Session topic
* Owner (public profile for contact)
* Guests (public profiles only)
* Consent status (yes / restricted / unclear)
* Credit preference (name / pseudonym)
* Review requested? (yes / no)
* Notes (audio issues, sensitive segments, forgot to hit record at start ...)
* Links (read more, related docs, guest handle)

### “Full metadata and credit” (for Internet Archive + publishing)

When preparing an upload/release, aim to include:

* Clear title (human-readable)
* Short description (2–5 sentences)
* Date + location (if public)
* Event name + context
* Creators/participants (as credited)
* Tags (topics + communities)
* Language
* License: CC BY-SA (or the agreed alternative)
* Related URLs (event page, guest links, transcript, slides)
* Any restrictions or sensitivities (documented privately; enforce in release)

---

## 9) Data management (don’t skip this)

### The rule

**No file leaves the station without a verified copy.**

### The routine

1. Copy to the primary drive
2. Copy to the backup drive
3. Verify (spot-check playback + file size match, or checksum if available)
4. Update the log: where each file lives

### What counts as “verified”

* Best: checksum verification (if the Data Steward is set up for it)
* Minimum: file size match + short playback check from the copied file

## 10) Equipment (optional) + bring-your-own gear

Equipment is not required to volunteer. The club does not provide equipment for activations — the Recording Station is assembled from volunteer-provided gear each time (and the space is coordinated with the host event).

For each activation, we agree on a baseline setup (the minimum kit and configuration we’ll rely on).

Depending on what volunteers bring, a baseline setup may include items like cameras, lights, handheld/lav mics, a portable mixer/recorder, storage media, and loads of adapters.

### If you want to bring your own gear (encouraged)

Bringing personal equipment is a great way to learn in a real production environment as long as it doesn’t add risk or complexity.

**Ground rules**

* Coordinate with the Technical Director before plugging anything in.
* Default to the baseline kit first; cutting-edge gear is “nice to have,” not mission-critical.
* Label your gear and keep track of your own batteries/media.

### What personal gear tends to help

* Headphones (closed-back)
* A known-good dynamic mic
* A small audio recorder
* Spare AA/AAA batteries, adapters, and gaffer tape

### Audio basics (what to listen for)

* **Too loud:** harsh distortion / clipping
* **Too quiet:** lots of hiss when you raise volume later
* **Clothing noise:** scratchy rubbing, tapping

---

## 11) Troubleshooting guide (quick)

* **No audio:** check mute switch → cable seating → input selection → battery/power
* **Distorted audio:** lower gain → move mic slightly farther → re-test
* **Wireless dropouts (if using wireless):** move receiver, change channel, reduce distance, avoid bodies blocking line of sight
* **Storage full:** offload + verify immediately; do not keep rolling “hoping it fits”

---

## 12) Safety + accessibility

* Keep walkways clear; tape down cables if used.
* Never block an exit.
* Ask before touching someone for lav mic placement; describe what you’re doing.
* Default to inclusive language; respect names and pronouns.

---

## 13) Communications

### Day-of comms

* Use the club’s agreed channel (Signal, Matrix, etc.)
* Share: energy level, schedule or equipment changes, urgent issues, handoff status

### What to share with the club after your shift

* Any technical or organizational issues
* Privacy/consent concerns
* What could you have had more of? (time, adapters, batteries, quiet space, extra hands, etc.)

---

## 14) After the event (what happens next)

You may not be involved in post-production, but it helps to know the pipeline.

### Pipeline overview

1. Activation files are ingested and organized
2. Owner approves (or requests adjustments / restrictions)
3. After owner approves the recording, source masters may be archived to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA (with full metadata and credit, unless a different arrangement was agreed)
4. Post-production release may also be prepared for YouTube/PeerTube or sharing on other channels.

### Community Fund note

Some post-production tasks may be funded and completed by contributors from the broader community. Tracking funded work and linking outputs into reporting is owned by the Post-Production Coordinator.

## 15) FAQs

**Do I need production experience?** No — curiosity, reliability and communication matter most.

**What if a guest changes their mind?** Stop recording. Note it. Tell the Lead Organizer.

**What if I make a mistake?** That's OK! Report it immediately; early fixes are easiest.
