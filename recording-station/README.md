# Zero-knowledge Audiovisual Club Recording Station

Helping communities document themselves to build an open, living archive for and by the people involved.

Our little media lab that drops into events. Step in, record, and play.

Nothing goes out without your OK. After that, the source lands in the public archive (CC BY-SA) with the credits and context intact.

## What this is

Most event coverage is top-down. Recording Station is the opposite: a place at the event where the people in the room can document themselves, on their own terms.

It can be a deep-dive conversation, a quick reflection, a hallway riff, a group recap, or something weird. We’re here for all of it.

Once you approve the recording, we get the source safely into the public archive (Internet Archive) with credits and context, then release it under CC BY-SA.

## Why we do it

* **Self-representation:** People choose to speak for themselves, not through a selection filter.

* **Connection:** A fun space to meet, collaborate, and riff.

* **Memory:** Insightful conversations become community memory—not lost in the hallway.

## What’s on the table

🎥 **Gear**

HD cams, lights, handheld & lav mics, portable mixer/recorder, and field kits for hallway interviews.

👥 **Crew**

We support setup and recording, and can help host if you want. Low-pressure, inclusive vibe.

🕓 **Sessions**

Walk in or book ahead: solo, pairs, roundtables, or live panels.

## Formats to spark inspiration

Podcast-style conversations • Short-form interviews • Panel recaps & event reactions • Personal video journals • Experimental/creative pieces

## Distribution & Licensing

* Consent and credits: clear approvals and attribution at every step. (If sensitive content needs alternatives, we’ll agree on it in advance.)

* Then open the source: after consent, original masters (audio/video) are released to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA.

* [Licensing + consent details](https://zkav.club/recording-station/licensing)

## How it flows

1. **Step in / book a slot:** Walk up or reserve a time.

2. **Record:** We handle mics, framing, and levels. Optional host or prompts if you want them.

3. **You review:** Watch/listen back and approve.

4. **We publish the source:** Originals go to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA with credits and context.
