# Zero-knowledge Audiovisual Club Recording Station 

Helping communities document themselves to build an open, living archive for and by the people involved. 

## TL;DR 

The Zk Av Club Recording Station is an on-site media lab that lets event-goers record conversations and insights with high-quality audio/video, contributing to a growing community-made archive. 

## What this is

We flip the script on event coverage: instead of top-down coverage, our Recording Station empowers in-person event attendees—builders, organizers, artists, researchers, and communities—to tell their stories on their own terms. 

From impromptu podcasts and deep-dive conversations to quick reflections and group discussions, we provide the tools and space to create authentic, high-quality content and preserve community memory. 

After recordings are approved by guests, the source recordings are published to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA. Open media, shared memory. 


## Why we do it

* **Self-representation:** People choose to speak for themselves, not through a selection filter. 

* **Connection:** A fun space to meet, collaborate, and riff. 

* **Memory:** Insightful conversations become community memory—not lost in the hallway. 


## What’s on the table

🎥 **Pro tools** 

HD cams, lights, handheld & lav mics, portable mixer/recorder, and field kits for hallway interviews. 

👥 **On-site help** 

Crew supports setup, recording, and (if you want) hosting. Low-pressure, inclusive vibe. 

🕓 **Flexible sessions** 

Walk in or book ahead—solo, pairs, roundtables, or live panels. 


## Formats to spark inspiration 

Podcast-style conversations • Short-form interviews • Panel recaps & event reactions • Personal video journals • Experimental/creative pieces 


## Distribution & Licensing 

* **Consent & credits:** Clear approvals, attribution, and metadata at every step. (If sensitive content requires alternatives, we can agree on it in advance.) 

* **Then open the source:** Following consent, original source masters (audio/video) are publicly released to Internet Archive under Creative Commons CC BY-SA.

## How it flows 

1. **Discover & book:** Walk up or reserve a slot. 

2. **Record:** Crew assists with mics, framing, and levels; optional host or prompts available. 

3. **Consent:** Review and approve the recording. 

4. **Archive:** Source masters are then uploaded to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA with full metadata and credit.
