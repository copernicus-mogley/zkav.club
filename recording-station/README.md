# Zero-knowledge Audiovisual Club Recording Station

Helping communities document themselves to build an open, living archive for and by the people involved.

An ad-hoc media lab that drops into events. Step in, record, and play.

Nothing goes out without your OK. After that, we publish the originals to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA (share + remix with attribution).

Want a feel for the vibe? Here are edited highlights from Berlin Blockchain Week 2025: [Recording Station sessions](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9eB_cR4oMehZCgFJqCIVPb253lVWnr8d). (Archive source drops coming soon.)

## What this is

Most event coverage is top-down. Recording Station is the opposite: a place at the event where the people in the room can document themselves, on their own terms.

It can be a deep-dive conversation, a quick reflection, a hallway riff, a group recap, or something weird. We’re here for all of it.

Once you approve the recording, we handle the upload to Internet Archive.

## Why we do it

* **Self-representation:** People choose to speak for themselves, not through a selection filter.

* **Connection:** A fun space to meet, collaborate, and riff.

* **Memory:** Insightful conversations become community memory—not lost in the hallway.

## What’s on the table

🎥 **Gear**

HD cams, lights, handheld & lav mics, portable mixer/recorder, and field kits for hallway interviews.

👥 **Crew**

We support setup and recording, and can help host if you want. Low-pressure, inclusive vibe.

🕓 **Sessions**

Walk in and sign up on-site: solo, pairs, roundtables, or live panels.

## Formats to spark inspiration

Podcast-style conversations • Short-form interviews • Panel recaps & event reactions • Personal video journals • Experimental/creative pieces

## Distribution & Licensing

* Consent and credits: clear approvals and attribution at every step. (If sensitive content needs alternatives, we’ll agree on it in advance.)

* Then open the source: after consent, original masters (audio/video) are released to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA.

* [Licensing + consent details](https://zkav.club/recording-station/licensing)

## How it flows

1. **Step in / sign up:** Walk up and grab a slot on-site.

2. **Record:** We handle mics, framing, and levels. Optional host or prompts if you want them.

3. **You review:** Watch/listen back and approve.

4. **We publish the source:** Originals go to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA.
