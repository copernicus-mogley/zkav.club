## Zero-knowledge Audiovisual Club

We help open-source and decentralized tech communities tell their own stories, without giving up privacy, and we return the results to an open community archive.

People, stories, tools.

We run Workshops, publish practical AV docs, and support meetups, hackathons, conferences, and camps so communities can keep their own record on their own terms.

Recording Station is volunteer-run. The rest gets funded through gigs, grants, sponsors, ecosystem support.

### Recording Station

Zk Av Club Recording Station is a simple setup we drop in at events so people can record solid audio/video without bringing gear or a production team.

You bring the conversation. We handle the mics, framing, and levels. We keep it chill, even when the room isn’t.

The content belongs to the creator(s) in it. Our job is to record it with care and steward the source safely into the public archive, with the context and credits that make it usable later, plus a respectful consent trail. Nothing goes out without your OK.

Then the source goes up: multi-angle camera originals and uncompressed audio. After guest approval, the originals are released under CC BY-SA.

The archive entry keeps the credits and context intact, ready for others to remix, reference, and build on.

What comes out of it is a shared public good: an open, community-made archive that future creators, filmmakers, and historians can actually use.

[Read the details](/recording-station/) (how it works, licensing + consent).

### Workshops

Zk Av Club Workshops are conversational, hands-on sessions where people learn by doing, together.

Bring questions. Bring half-finished ideas.

They’re intentionally broad: they can be technical or non-technical, beginner-friendly or advanced, and in any language, with a bias toward FOSS, privacy, and decentralized (p2p) tech. If it helps someone do something real, it probably fits.

Formats range from demos and guided exercises to teardown sessions, clinic-style troubleshooting, and “build with me” experiments. The goal isn’t a lecture to a quiet room, it’s a session people can take part in.

Facilitators are paid in Zcash, and workshops are recorded and published so the knowledge keeps working after the live moment. Recording is required for facilitator payment; if a session can’t be recorded, it doesn’t run as a Zk Av Club Workshop.

### Publishing Infrastructure

Platforms change the rules mid-season. Accounts get flagged. Viewers get tracked. If you want your archive to outlive the platform mood swings, start here.

We help communities build media homes they can depend on:

* Publishing systems: community-controlled media (Fediverse and beyond), setup/admin, repeatable workflows, and organization for discovery.

* Stewardship and governance: consent defaults, moderation support, takedown/reporting workflows, roles/permissions, and versioning/updates.

We’re trying to make decentralized publishing feel nice. What you get: the stack, the workflow, and the runbook.

A lot of this is quiet work (permissions, policies, workflows). Some of it is solid ops. Some of it is experiments in the wild: p2p distribution (seeding, mirroring, relays), new sharing protocols, and keeping what actually works.

Zcash PeerTube is our first public implementation, but it’s just one example.

### Testimonials

> Zk Av Club is a throwback to the grassroots ethos of the early days of the crypto revolution. Uncompromising in their community-first approach to audio/visual education and support, Zk Av Club gives a voice to the individuals behind the camera, in the booth, working before, during and after the event to share the news and progress the world needs to know. The Zcash Foundation was an early champion for the Club and we remain invested in their present and their bright future. The world needs more impactful and community-led projects like Zk Av Club!

> I've always been fascinated with how folks find things because it illustrates a unique mapping. On its face, this might seem insignificant, but if you study these mappings on a deeper level, you realize something special; a shielded truth. On my journey discovering Zcash, I randomly discovered Adjy Leak, and in conjunction, Zk Av Club. Through the club, I experienced not only my first time connecting with *many* like-minded folks through live streaming, but also a vast archive of knowledge I didn't even know existed! If you like adventure, computer science, and community, I couldn't recommend a better environment to start your journey.

> Ryan and Zk Av Club are great, not just a streaming and media team but also deep community leadership and advocacy. They have been a reliable fixture of the Zcash community as well as adjacent ones like DWeb, and has helped make connections with other local communities around the globe, such as Zcash Brazil. They've run self-contained livestream and recording for Zcash conferences, as well as hosting chill hybrid and remote hangouts. My favorite is seeing Ryan bring AV training sessions to newly formed local groups with minimal equipment, empowering them to improve their own global media abilities and stay included.

> Zk Av Club is a source of inspiration for me and for everyone who comes. Seeing the work they do behind the scenes and then the staging in each event or streaming, is definitely a motivation to learn more about everything audiovisual. As a member of the team I can say that every day is an opportunity to learn, grow and contribute from my knowledge as well. Long live the club!
