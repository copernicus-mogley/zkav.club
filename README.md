### Recording Station

Zk Av Club Recording Station is a simple setup we bring to events so people can record solid audio/video without needing their own gear or a production team.

You bring the conversation. We handle the mics, framing, and levels. You get final approval before anything goes out.

How it works: Step in / sign up • Record • You review + approve • Then we upload the source masters to Internet Archive under CC BY-SA.

Formats: Podcast-style conversations • Short interviews • Panel recaps • Personal video journals • Weird experiments.

[Read the details](/recording-station/) (including licensing + consent).

### Workshops

Zk Av Club Workshops are conversational learning sessions where people learn by doing. They’re community-led and intentionally broad: it can be technical or non-technical, beginner-friendly or advanced, and in any language—always with a bias toward FOSS, privacy, and decentralized (p2p) tech.

Formats range from demos and guided exercises to teardown sessions, clinic-style troubleshooting, and “build with me” experiments. If it helps a community do something real, it probably fits.

Facilitators are supported and paid in Zcash—and workshops are recorded + published so the knowledge keeps working after the live moment. Recording is required for facilitator payment; if a session can’t be recorded, it doesn’t run as a Zk Av Club Workshop.

### Testimonials

Zk Av Club is a throwback to the grassroots ethos of the early days of the crypto revolution. Uncompromising in their community-first approach to audio/visual education and support, Zk Av Club gives a voice to the individuals behind the camera, in the booth, working before, during and after the event to share the news and progress the world needs to know. The Zcash Foundation was an early champion for the Club and we remain invested in their present and their bright future. The world needs more impactful and community-led projects like Zk Av Club!

For years, Ryan Taylor and Zk Av Club have provided exceptional live streaming for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency events, ensuring global reach and high-quality broadcasts. Their dedication is unmatched.

I've always been fascinated with how folks find things because it illustrates a unique mapping. On its face, this might seem insignificant, but if you study these mappings on a deeper level, you realize something special; a shielded truth. On my journey discovering Zcash, I randomly discovered Adjy Leak, and in conjunction, Zk Av Club. Through the club, I experienced not only my first time connecting with *many* like minded folks through live streaming, but also a vast archive of knowledge I didn't even know existed! If you like adventure, computer science, and community, I couldn't recommend a better environment to start your journey.

Ryan and Zk Av Club are great, not just a streaming and media team but also deep community leadership and advocacy. They have been a reliable fixture of the Zcash community as well as adjacent ones like DWeb, and has helped make connections with other local communities around the globe, such as Zcash Brazil. They've run self contained livestream and recording for Zcash conferences, as well as hosting chill hybrid and remote hangouts. My favorite is seeing Ryan bring AV training sessions to newly formed local groups with minimal equipment, empowering them to improve their own global media abilities and stay included.

It has been hugely beneficial to our work over at ZecHub. So if you're intending to or currently building a project, hop into the Discord and see what's cooking!

the club is also big on experimenting. each member can use their new knowledge to start creating something they want or join forces with others to collaborate. best part is when you find a chance to be part of some on-location events or workshops with other club members.

join it and find out if its something for you.

Zk Av Club is a source of inspiration for me and for everyone who comes. Seeing the work they do behind the scenes and then the staging in each event or streaming, is definitely a motivation to learn more about everything audiovisual. As a member of the team I can say that every day is an opportunity to learn, grow and contribute from my knowledge as well. Long live the club!

— [@SoyAuraBrito](https://x.com/SoyAuraBrito)

The AV Club has been a space for me to connect with technology, open source and content generation geeks like me.

I like being part of the team because there is freedom of creativity, opinion and action. Although we all work for the same purpose (teaching and spreading privacy and free technologies), we can all have our style with freedom.

I hope more people join the Club and enjoy the experience!

I worked with Zk AV Club in Berlin to produce my talk for ZConV. They ran the entire virtual event with a lean team, and made it very engaging and interactive. I appreciate their deep knowledge of the privacy space and their contributions to events in the community, and hope to work with them on many projects to come.

Ryan is a pro. His production work is top shelf as evidenced by his work on Zcons through the years, and his commitment to providing engaging and informative content. With Zk Av Club he continues his dedication and professionalism while also widening the tent to welcome and include new voices from all around the world and across industries. His professionalism, empathy and deep interest in the topics and people he’s engaged with shines above all.

The diversity of backgrounds and languages is celebrated, fostering a rich communal spirit.

Beyond being an incubator for creativity, ZK AV has evolved into a highly effective organization. They leverage their expertise in audiovisual production, zero-knowledge technologies, and blockchain to elevate events to new heights.
