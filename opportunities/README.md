# Opportunities

Work comes in waves. When it does, we want a call list of people who can jump in and make something real.

We’re stewarding an archive that future creators, historians, and builders can actually use. Because community memory shouldn’t depend on someone else’s terms of service.

That takes more than recording. It takes transcripts, clips, edits, graphics, thumbnails, livestream finesse, and the care work that turns raw files into complete items. Care work = organizing, labeling, checking, and following up so items move reliably from the event to the public archive and stay usable.

Some gigs are one-off. Some are recurring. If you want to be on the list, this page is the doorway.

## How it works

Most of the work here is paid, per contribution (for example: a transcript cleanup, a clip, a thumbnail set, an edit pass).

Two important notes:

* **Recording Station crew** is volunteer-only (that service is intentionally community-run). See: [Volunteer Kit](/recording-station/volunteer/) and [licensing + consent](/recording-station/licensing/).
* **Coordinator roles** (below) are paid monthly.

When you join a gigs network:

* Start in **Get involved** below.
* When work shows up, we reach out with what it is, when it’s due, and what it pays (you’ll always see the rate before accepting).
* If you’re available, you take the gig. If not, no stress.

We keep scopes readable and credits real.

## Coordinator roles

We have two roles we’re actively staffing right now. These are mostly async roles, paid monthly through the end of 2026 (with a chance to extend).

Mostly async (work on your own schedule, with deadlines and occasional check-ins).

These are coordinating roles that work across the club (not one-off gigs). You’re the glue between “we recorded it” and “it’s usable forever.”

### The Archivist

You’re the person who makes sure the source survives.

**Time**: ~10 hours/week

**What you do**

* Turn a pile of files into a real archive item: source, credits, consent notes (who approved what, and any boundaries), context, and a clean handoff. (Owner = the main contact responsible for approvals.)
* Decide what details actually matter for each item type: keep templates sane, evolve the schema as the archive grows.
* Cooperate with other club coordinators to assemble the full package (audio/video from the post-production coordinator, text from the Storyteller, and any missing pieces).
* Keep the “source of truth” file up to date as the item evolves (links, versions, consent status, credits, notes).
* Publish original files to the public archive ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) today), with the details needed to make them usable later. (See [Recording Station licensing + consent](/recording-station/licensing/).)
* Keep simple inventories so nothing disappears: what exists, where it lives, what’s missing, what needs follow-up.

Success = someone finds it two years later and can actually use it.

**You’re a fit if you**

* Care about archival hygiene and don’t mind “care work” (organizing, labeling, checking details, and following up).
* Can follow a workflow and improve it over time (including making details templates clearer and more useful).
* Write clearly and keep a chill, respectful tone with creators and teams.

**Tools we like (not required)**

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) workflows (plus [Recording Station context](/recording-station/) and [licensing + consent](/recording-station/licensing/)), basic media tooling, spreadsheets, checklists/task boards, and file naming/versioning discipline.

### The Storyteller

You’re the person who helps the archive feel alive.

**Time**: ~8 hours/week

**What you do**

* Coordinate the transcription roster (scribes) to get accurate transcripts (and fix the weird bits).
* Pull quotes, moments, and through-lines from recordings.
* Turn that into a clean text package — good titles, clean descriptions, useful tags, and the kind of context future creators, historians, and builders will thank us for.
* Hand the text package to the Archivist (transcript + title/description/tags/quotes + any notes that help publish it right).
* Keep public indexes readable and browseable (the workshops page, archive lists, and collections people browse), in collaboration with the Archivist.

Success = the right person clicks, understands, and shares it without needing a guide.

**You’re a fit if you**

* Can listen/watch quickly and find the thread.
* Write clean copy with personality, without hype.
* Like collaborating with editors, organizers, and creators.

**Tools we like (not required)**

Text-first workflows (docs/markdown/whatever the project uses), basic editing literacy, simple publishing/index workflows, and comfort working from transcripts.

**Apply / raise your hand**

To apply, DM us via the **Join the Club** links on the homepage (see Get involved below) and include:

* which role you want (Archivist / Storyteller)
* your timezone + availability
* confirm you’re good with mostly async work and monthly pay through the end of 2026 (with possible extension)
* links to past work (or a short description)
* what kinds of communities/events you’re into

## Gigs (call list)

These are the skill networks we’re building: groups of people we can call on when we need transcription, clips, editing, motion, livestream help, and more.

This is the call list for people who like shipping media with care.

Want on the list? Start in **Get involved** below.

(If you already DM’d us for something else, just say “add me to the call list,” share your skill(s), and drop a link to your work.)

### Workshops

We’re building a network of **workshop facilitators** for conversational, learn-by-doing sessions.

You pick the topic and host it. We can talk about format, livestreaming, and archiving, and decide what’s doable on a case-by-case basis.

To get paid, the recording needs to be published on your channel(s) after the session (YouTube, PeerTube, etc.). Share the link and we’ll do the rest.

Start here: [apply to facilitate](https://tally.so/r/A7B0MD). Program details: [Workshops program](/workshops/) and [past sessions](/workshops/past/).

### Transcription (scribes)

Transcription is split into two parts. One person can do both, or we can split it across two people. We split it because AI is fast, but humans make it true.

* **Part 1: AI-assisted draft**

  * Generate the first transcript pass with AI tools.
  * Include speaker labels and rough timestamps when possible.

* **Part 2: Human review**

  * Clean up names, jargon, and technical terms.
  * Fix timing, missing words, and confusing sections.
  * Pull a few strong quotes that help the Storyteller write titles, descriptions, tags, and summaries.

This network is coordinated by the Storyteller.

### Event production

* **Camera Operator:** Handheld, tripod, multi-cam.
* **Livestream Technician:** Keep the audio/video flow stable: OBS/scenes, audio, network, routing.
* **Livestream Producer:** Show flow, cues, coordination, calm. Make it happen.

### Post-production

* **Editing:** Long-form edits. (Example: one full talk or one full conversation, cleaned up and ready to publish.)
* **Clips:** 2–4× 30–60s videos for social.
* **Thumbnails:** Clean, consistent packages in multiple sizes. (Example: one thumbnail design delivered in 16:9 + 1:1 + 9:16.)
* **Motion Graphics:** Lower thirds, bumpers, simple packages.

## Volunteer (Recording Station crew)

[Recording Stations](/recording-station/) are volunteer-run on purpose. No minimum commitment — help when you can. If you want to help on-site (setup, audio, camera, session wrangling, hosting), start here:

* [Recording Station Volunteer Kit](/recording-station/volunteer/)

## What we care about

* Privacy-first by default (consent, boundaries, no weird surprises)
* A bias toward free/open-source and decentralized (p2p) tools when it makes sense
* Straightforward scopes and credits that don’t get “forgotten”

## Get involved

* Want in? DM us via the [Join the Club links on the homepage](/#join-the-club) with your skill(s) or role, timezone, availability, and samples (or a short description). We’ll review it and follow up if we need anything else before adding you to the call list.
* Have an event lead for Recording Station or a paid gig? [Drop it here](https://tally.so/r/VLJ22E).
* Want to facilitate a workshop? Apply here: [workshop facilitator form](https://tally.so/r/A7B0MD). Program details: [/workshops/](/workshops/).
* Want to support a project or sponsor an activation? See: [Support Zk Av Club](/#support-zk-av-club) and [Publishing Infrastructure](/publishing-infrastructure/).

## Notes

* Gigs are paid in Zcash. Work done in a given month is paid at the start of the following month.
* We work across communities and ecosystems; sometimes the event pays, sometimes a grant or sponsor does. Sometimes we’re scrappy.
* Coordinator roles are mostly async and collaborative: you’ll be working with other coordinators and the gigs call list to assemble complete deliverables.
* Our default is lightweight and text-first: each Recording Station item keeps a simple “source of truth” file that evolves with the item (format is flexible).
* New but hungry? Tell us. We can match some gigs to learning paths.
