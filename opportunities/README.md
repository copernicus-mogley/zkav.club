# Opportunities

Work comes in waves. When it does, we want people who can step in and help carry it through.

We’re stewarding an archive designed for future creators, historians, and builders to actually use, without depending on someone else’s terms of service. That takes more than recording. It takes transcripts, clips, edits, graphics, thumbnails, livestream finesse, and care work that keeps items moving from the event to the public archive.

Some gigs are one-off and some recur. If you want to be in the network, this page is how you get in.

## How it works

Most work here is paid per contribution (for example: a transcript cleanup, a clip, a thumbnail set, an edit pass).

Two important notes (jump links): [Volunteer](#volunteer-recording-station-crew) • [Coordinator roles](#coordinator-roles).

* **Recording Station crew** is volunteer-only (that service is intentionally community-run). Details in [Volunteer](#volunteer-recording-station-crew).

* **Coordinator roles** (see [below](#coordinator-roles)) are paid monthly.

When you join a skill network:

* See [Get involved](#get-involved) below.

* When work shows up, we reach out with what it is, when it’s due, and what it pays (you’ll always see what it pays before accepting).

* If you’re available, you take the gig. If not, no stress.

We keep scopes readable and credits real. See [What we care about](#what-we-care-about).

## Coordinator roles

We have two roles we’re actively staffing right now. These are mostly async roles, paid monthly through the end of 2026 (with a chance to extend).

Mostly async (work on your own schedule, with deadlines and occasional check-ins).

These are coordinating roles that work across the club (not one-off gigs). You’re the glue between “we recorded it” and “it’s ready for the long run.”

### The Archivist

You’re the person who makes sure the source survives.

**Time**: ~10 hours/week

**What you do**

* Turn a pile of files into a real archive item: source, credits, consent notes (who approved what, and any boundaries), context, and a clean handoff. (Owner = Recording Station term for the main contact responsible for approvals.)

* Decide what details actually matter for each item type: keep templates sane, evolve the schema as the archive grows.

* Cooperate with other club coordinators to assemble the full package (audio/video from the post-production coordinator, text from the Storyteller, and any missing pieces).

* Keep the “source of truth” file up to date as the item evolves (links, versions, consent status, credits, notes).

* Publish original files to the public archive ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) today, or whatever host makes sense as the archive evolves), with the details needed to make them usable later. (See [Recording Station licensing + consent](/recording-station/licensing/).)

* Keep simple inventories so nothing disappears: what exists, where it lives, what’s missing, what needs follow-up.

Success = someone finds it two years later and can actually use it.

**You’re a fit if you**

* Care about archival hygiene and don’t mind “care work” (organizing, labeling, checking details, and following up).

* Can follow a workflow and improve it over time (including making details templates clearer and more useful).

* Write clearly and keep a chill, respectful tone with creators and teams.

**Tools we like (not required)**

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) workflows (plus [Recording Station context](/recording-station/) and [licensing + consent](/recording-station/licensing/)), basic media tooling, spreadsheets, checklists/task boards, and file naming/versioning discipline.

### The Storyteller

You’re the person who helps the archive speak clearly.

**Time**: ~8 hours/week

**What you do**

* Coordinate the network of scribes to get accurate transcripts (see [Transcription](#transcription-scribes)), and fix the weird bits.

* Pull quotes, moments, and through-lines from recordings.

* Turn that into the text layer that makes the recording usable later: good titles, clean descriptions, useful tags, and the kind of context future creators, historians, and builders will thank us for.

* Hand the text package to the Archivist (transcript + title/description/tags/quotes + any notes that help publish it right).

* Keep public indexes readable and browseable (the workshops page, archive lists, and collections people browse), in collaboration with the Archivist.

Success = someone finds it years later, understands what it is, and can build from it.

**You’re a fit if you**

* Can listen/watch quickly and find the thread.

* Write clean copy with personality, without hype.

* Like collaborating with editors, organizers, and creators.

**Tools we like (not required)**

Text-first workflows (docs/markdown/whatever the project uses), basic editing literacy, simple publishing/index workflows, and comfort working from transcripts.

**Apply / raise your hand**

To apply, DM us via the [Join the Club links on the homepage](/#join-the-club) (see [Get involved](#get-involved)) and include:

* which role you want (Archivist / Storyteller)

* your timezone + availability

* confirm you’re good with mostly async work and monthly pay through the end of 2026 (with possible extension)

* links to past work (or a short description)

* what kinds of communities/events you’re into

## Gigs (skill networks)

These are the skill networks we’re building: people we can call on for transcription, clips, editing, motion, livestream help, and more. (If we don’t have work for your skill right now, we’ll keep your link on file.)

This is the call list for people who want the work to live on.

Want in? Start in [Get involved](#get-involved) below.

(If you already DM’d us for something else, just say “add me to the network,” share your skill(s), and drop a link to your work.)

### Workshops

We’re building a network of **workshop facilitators** for conversational, learn-by-doing sessions.

You pick the topic and host it. We can talk about format, livestreaming, and archiving, and decide what’s doable on a case-by-case basis.

To get paid, the recording needs to be published on your channel(s) after the session (YouTube, PeerTube, etc.). Share the link and we’ll confirm it meets the program requirements, then we’ll confirm payment.

Start here: [apply to facilitate](https://tally.so/r/A7B0MD). Learn about the program: [Zk Av Club Workshops](/workshops/). Browse: [past sessions](/workshops/past/).

### Transcription (scribes)

Transcription is split into two parts. One person can do both, or we can split it across two people. We split it because AI is fast, but humans make it true.

* **Part 1: AI-assisted draft**

  * Generate the first transcript pass with AI tools.
  * Include speaker labels and rough timestamps when possible.

* **Part 2: Human review**

  * Clean up names, jargon, and technical terms.
  * Fix timing, missing words, and confusing sections.
  * Pull a few strong quotes that help the [Storyteller](#the-storyteller) write titles, descriptions, tags, and summaries.

The network of scribes is coordinated by the [Storyteller](#the-storyteller).

### Event production

* **Camera Operator:** Handheld, tripod, multi-cam.

* **Livestream Technician:** Keep the audio/video flow stable: OBS/scenes, audio, network, routing.

* **Livestream Producer:** Show flow, cues, coordination, calm. Run the show nice and steady.

### Post-production

* **Editing:** Long-form edits. (Example: one full talk or one full conversation, cleaned up and ready to publish.)

* **Clips:** 2–4× 30–60s videos for social.

* **Thumbnails:** Clean, consistent thumbnails sized for where they’ll live. (Example: one thumbnail design delivered in 16:9 + 1:1 + 9:16.)

* **Motion Graphics:** Lower thirds, bumpers, simple packages.

## Volunteer (Recording Station crew)

[Recording Stations](/recording-station/) are volunteer-run on purpose. No minimum commitment. Help when you can.

If you want to help on-site (setup, audio, camera, session wrangling, hosting), start here:

* [Recording Station Volunteer Kit](/recording-station/volunteer/)

## What we care about

* Privacy-first by default (consent, boundaries, no weird surprises)

* A bias toward free/open-source and decentralized (p2p) tools when it makes sense

* Straightforward scopes and credits that don’t get “forgotten”

## Get involved

* Want in? DM us via the [Join the Club links on the homepage](/#join-the-club) with your skill(s) or role, timezone, availability, and samples (or a short description). A coordinator will review it and follow up if there’s a potential fit.

* Have an event lead for Recording Station or a paid gig? [Drop it here](https://tally.so/r/VLJ22E).

* Want to facilitate a workshop? Apply here: [workshop facilitator form](https://tally.so/r/A7B0MD). Submitting the form starts a conversation. We’ll follow up. Learn about the program: [Zk Av Club Workshops](/workshops/).

* Want to support a project or sponsor an activation? See: [Support Zk Av Club](/#support-zk-av-club) and [Publishing Infrastructure](/publishing-infrastructure/).

## Notes

* Gigs are paid in Zcash. Work done in a given month is paid at the start of the following month.

* We work across communities and ecosystems; sometimes the event pays, sometimes a grant or sponsor does. Sometimes we’re working with what we’ve got.

* [Coordinator roles](#coordinator-roles) are mostly async and collaborative: you’ll be working with other coordinators and the [gigs networks](#gigs-skill-networks) to assemble complete deliverables.

* Our default is lightweight and text-first: each Recording Station item keeps a simple “source of truth” file that evolves with the item (format is flexible).

* New but hungry? Tell us. When it makes sense, we can match some gigs to learning paths.
