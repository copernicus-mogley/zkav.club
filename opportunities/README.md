# Opportunities

Work comes in waves. When it does, we’re glad to have people who can step in and carry it through.

We’re stewarding an archive designed for future creators, historians, and builders to actually use. That takes more than recording. It takes transcripts, clips, edits, graphics, livestream finesse, and the care work that moves items from the event to the public archive and beyond.

Some gigs are one-off. Some recur. If you want to be in a skill network, this page is how you get in.

## How it works

Most work here is paid per contribution: transcript cleanup, clips, thumbnails, edits.

Two important notes:

* Recording Station crew is volunteer-only. Details in [Volunteer](#volunteer-recording-station-crew).

* Coordinator roles (see [below](#coordinator-roles)) are paid monthly.

**Skill networks**

If you want to help outside the open roles, join a skill network (transcription, event production, post-production, and more). Start with [Gigs (skill networks)](#gigs-skill-networks), then follow the steps in [Get involved](#get-involved).

When work shows up, we share what it is, when it’s due, and what it pays. If you’re available, you take it. If not, no stress.

We keep scopes simple: what it is, what ‘done’ means, and what it pays. See [What we care about](#what-we-care-about).

## Coordinator roles

We have two roles we’re actively staffing right now. Paid monthly through the end of 2026 (with a chance to extend).

Work is mostly async: you work on your own schedule, with deadlines and occasional check-ins.

These are coordinating roles that work across the club. You’re the glue between "we recorded it" and "it’s ready for the long run."

### The Archivist

You’re the person who makes sure the source survives.

**Time**: ~10 hours/week

**What you do**

* Turn a pile of files into a real archive item: source, credits, consent notes (who approved what, and any boundaries), context, and a clean handoff.

* Decide what details actually matter for each item type: keep templates sane, evolve the schema as the archive grows.

* Cooperate with other club coordinators to assemble the full package (audio/video from the post-production coordinator, text from the Storyteller, and any missing pieces).

* Keep the "source of truth" file up to date as the item evolves (links, versions, consent status, credits, notes).

* Publish original files to the public archive ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) today, or whatever host makes sense as the archive evolves), with the details needed to make them usable later. (See [Recording Station licensing + consent](/recording-station/licensing/).)

* Keep simple inventories so nothing disappears: what exists, where it lives, what’s missing, what needs follow-up.

Success = someone finds it two years later and can actually use it.

**You’re a fit if you**

* You like detail-heavy care work: organizing, labeling, checking, and following up.

* You can triage and keep a queue moving (even with messy inputs).

* You can make judgment calls and improve templates over time.

* You write clearly and treat consent + credits as real obligations.

**Tools we like (not required)**

Text-first workflows (docs/markdown/whatever the project uses), spreadsheets, basic editing literacy, simple publishing/index workflows, and comfort working from transcripts.

### The Storyteller

You’re the person who helps the archive speak clearly.

**Time**: ~8 hours/week

**What you do**

* Coordinate the [network of scribes](#transcription-scribes) so transcripts are accurate, readable, and delivered on time.

* Listen/watch fast and find the thread. Pull the names, terms, and context that make the recording understandable later.

* Turn that into the text layer that makes the recording usable later: good titles, clean descriptions, useful tags, and the kind of context future creators, historians, and builders will thank us for.

* Keep public indexes readable and browsable (the workshops page, archive lists, and collections people browse), in collaboration with the Archivist.

* Hand off transcripts and text elements to the Archivist (title, description, tags, quotes, notes, links).

Success = someone finds it years later, understands what it is, and can build from it.

**You’re a fit if you**

* You can listen/watch fast and find the thread.

* You can write context that still works years later (not hype, not SEO).

* You can coordinate scribes and raise quality gently.

* You hand off clean text packages so the Archivist can publish without friction.

**Tools we like (not required)**

Clear writing, comfort working from transcripts, and a good sense for what context will matter later.

**Apply / raise your hand**

To apply, DM us via the [Join the Club links on the homepage](/#join-the-club) (see [Get involved](#get-involved)) and include:

* which role you want (Archivist / Storyteller)

* your timezone + availability

* confirm you’re good with mostly async work and monthly pay through the end of 2026 (with possible extension)

* links to past work (or a short description)

* what kinds of communities/events you’re into

## Gigs (skill networks)

These are the skill networks we’re building: people we can reach when we need transcription, clips, editing, motion, livestream help, and more. (If we don’t have work for your skill right now, we’ll keep your link on file.)

This is the call list for people who want the work to live on.

Want on the list? Start in [Get involved](#get-involved) below.

If you already DM’d us for something else, just say "add me to the network," share your skill(s), and drop a link to your work.

### Workshops

We want to build relationships with **workshop facilitators** who can lead us in conversational, learn-by-doing sessions.

You pick the topic and host it. We can talk about format, livestreaming, and archiving, and decide what’s doable on a case-by-case basis.

To get paid, the recording needs to be published on your channel(s) after the session (Internet Archive, YouTube, PeerTube, etc.). Share the link. We’ll check it meets requirements, then confirm payment.

Start here: [apply to facilitate](https://tally.so/r/A7B0MD). Learn about the program: [Zk Av Club Workshops](/workshops/). Browse: [past sessions](/workshops/past/).

### Transcription (scribes)

Transcription is split into two parts. One person can do both, or we can split it across two people. We split it because AI is fast, but humans make it true.

* **AI-assisted draft:** Generate the first transcript pass with AI tools, including speaker labels and rough timestamps when possible.

* **Human review:** Clean up names, jargon, and technical terms. Fix timing and missing words. Pull a few strong quotes that help the [Storyteller](#the-storyteller) shape titles, descriptions, and summaries.

The [network of scribes](#transcription-scribes) is coordinated by the [Storyteller](#the-storyteller).

### Event production

Event production work is tied to real dates and real rooms. When we’re staffed and funded, we bring these skills in to make the recording clean and the live moment steady. If you join this skill network, expect irregular timing. We confirm scope and pay before anything is booked.

* **Camera Operator:** Handheld, tripod, multi-cam.

* **Livestream Technician:** Keep the audio/video flow stable: OBS/scenes, audio, network, routing.

* **Livestream Producer:** Show flow, cues, coordination, calm. Run the show nice and steady.

### Post-production

These skills matter. For now they’re funding-dependent and more occasional while we prioritize getting source material safely published and documented. Expect lighter and less predictable volume for now.

* **Editing:** Long-form edits. Example: one full talk or one full conversation, cleaned up and ready to publish.

* **Clips:** 2–4× 30–60s videos for social.

* **Thumbnails:** Clean, consistent thumbnails sized for where they’ll live. Example: one thumbnail design delivered in 16:9 + 1:1 + 9:16.

* **Motion Graphics:** Lower thirds, bumpers, simple packages.

## Volunteer (Recording Station crew)

[Recording Stations](/recording-station/) are volunteer-run on purpose. No minimum commitment. Help when you can.

If you want to help on-site (setup, audio, camera, session wrangling, hosting), start here:

* [Recording Station Volunteer Kit](/recording-station/volunteer/)

## What we care about

* Straightforward scopes and credits. If we miss something, we fix it.

* We care about future usefulness, not the algorithm.

* Privacy-first by default (consent, boundaries, no weird surprises)

* A bias toward free/open-source and decentralized (p2p) tools, with pragmatism when needed.

## Get involved

Want in on a skill network? DM us via the [Join the Club links on the homepage](/#join-the-club) and include:

* which skill(s) you want to help with (and which section: Workshops, Transcription, Event production, Post-production)

* your timezone + typical availability

* links to past work (or a short description)

* any languages you can work in

We’ll review what you send and follow up if there’s a potential fit.

New but hungry? Tell us. When it makes sense, we can match some gigs to learning paths.

## Before you jump in

* **Pay + timing:** Gigs are paid in Zcash. Work done in a given month is paid at the start of the following month.

* **Funding reality:** We work across communities and ecosystems. Sometimes the event pays, sometimes a grant or sponsor does. Sometimes we’re working with what we’ve got.

* **How the work moves:** Coordinator roles and skill networks move items from “recorded” to published, with credits, consent notes, and simple "source of truth" files that evolve over time to keep the archive consistent.
